# Nexus — Ideas in Motion

An ultra-modern portfolio that showcases your **hardware & software ideas** in a clear,
easy-to-understand way — and lets visitors **vote** on which project should be built
next. Some ideas are finished products, others are just mockups; every one is labelled
with its stage so people know exactly what they're looking at.

Built with **Next.js (App Router)**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, **Framer
Motion** and **Prisma + SQLite**.

## Features

- **Showcase gallery** — animated, glassmorphic cards for every project with a cover
  image, category (hardware / software), stage badge and tags.
- **Clear status for every idea** — `Idea → Mockup → Prototype → In Progress →
  Completed`, so mockups are never mistaken for shipped products.
- **Community voting** — one tap to upvote (and tap again to remove). Votes are stored
  in the database and attributed to an anonymous per-browser key, so the same person
  can't stuff the ballot. Sort the showcase by **Top voted** or **Newest**.
- **Search & filters** — filter by category and stage, or search across titles, summaries
  and tags.
- **Admin upload area** (`/admin`) — password-protected dashboard to publish new
  projects, upload cover images (or paste an image URL), feature standouts, and delete
  projects.
- **Ultra-modern design** — animated aurora background, gradient accents, frosted glass
  surfaces, smooth motion, fully responsive.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (also generates the Prisma client)
npm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
#   then edit ADMIN_PASSWORD in .env

# 3. Create the database and apply migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# 4. (Optional) load sample projects
npm run db:seed

# 5. Run the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The admin area lives at
[http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin).

## Environment variables

| Variable         | Description                                              | Default      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `DATABASE_URL`   | SQLite connection string (relative to `prisma/`).        | `file:./dev.db` |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Password required to access the `/admin` upload area.    | `changeme`   |

> **Change `ADMIN_PASSWORD` before deploying.** The login sets an HTTP-only cookie
> containing an HMAC of the password — the raw password is never stored client-side.

## Project structure

```

## Useful scripts

| Script             | What it does                                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`      | Start the development server                    |
| `npm run build`    | Generate the Prisma client and build for prod   |
| `npm run start`    | Run the production build                        |
| `npm run lint`     | Lint with ESLint                                |
| `npm run db:seed`  | Seed sample projects                            |
| `npm run db:reset` | Drop, re-migrate and re-seed the database       |

## Notes on deployment

This app uses a local SQLite database and stores uploaded images on the local
filesystem (`public/uploads`). That works great for self-hosting / a long-running
Node server (e.g. a VPS, Fly.io, Railway, Render). For ephemeral/serverless platforms
where the filesystem isn't persistent, point `DATABASE_URL` at a hosted database and
swap image uploads for an object store (S3, R2, etc.).
